# GoCreate

GoCreate is a command-line interface (CLI) application built in Go. It's designed as a learning tool for web development, providing a user-friendly interface to experiment and learn.

## Getting Started

To run the application, navigate to the project directory and use the `go run` command:

```bash
go run . website
```

## Features

- **Learning Web Development**: GoCreate provides a hands-on approach to learning web development.
- **Menu Management**: Learn how to manage a website's menu with intuitive commands.
- **Debugging**: Built-in debugging capabilities to help you troubleshoot and learn from issues.

## Testing

GoCreate uses the `ExecuteCommand` function for testing its commands. This function executes a command and captures its output, allowing for assertions about the command's behavior.
